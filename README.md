## Competetitive Analysis

1. The first webiste I reviewed was https://www.weather.gov/help-past-weather. When you first enter the site the homepage gives an overview on what it does, 
instructions on how to use the site, and contact information for customer service. On the left side of the homepage there is a table that prompts for what city and state you want to
get the weather for. When entering that information, it shows the current weather, it then shows the high and low for that day, and the forecast for the following day. Furhter
into the site you can review things such as past weather, saftey information, news, and even links for educational purposes related to weather.


2. The second website I reviewed was https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/home.html. This site presents official weather observations, forecasts, and climatological information for selected
cites across the world. First you are prompted to select a continent, then a country, and from there you can select specific towns or citites. This site then shows the current temperaturs,
the high and low, a seven day forecast, and even a few different graphs and charts for past weather data. This site bases its information on monthly averages over 30 years. The site also
offers links for personalizing your experience, what new, and severe weather.


3. The last website I reviewed was https://www.wunderground.com. This site had more differences than the first two I visited. When you first enter the site on the homepage, you are faced
with a tool bar the offers links to maps and radars, severe weather, news and blogs, mobile apps, and more. Below that another bar displays the current weather and tempatures for popular
cities around the U.S.. You can then search for specific locations similarly to the other webpages I reviewed, however, with this site when searching a location, along with the
standard information, it also displays immediately major news stories for area. This site also goes a little further into depth and displays things such as precipitation, pollen, air quality,
and uv index. It also displays information for additional conditions like pressure, visibility, clouds, dew point, and even details about astronomy. The immediate difference with this site
was with out even clicking every minute or so you are faced with a pop up for advertisement.

## GitHub Repository Research

1. The first github repo I found relative to my project was a repo title Weather-App. This page feature a weather app that simply asks for your city, then displays the current tempature
and weather and also shows when the sunrise is, the humidity, the wind, and the pressure. The site was set up fairly simple with a rectangular style seach box in the middle of the screen
where all of the information is displayed. My main take away from this was that, I may be able to make my website feel simplier and easier to use than expected.

2. The next github repo I found closely related to my project was a repo also titled Weather App. This particular one was quite different than the first one I found. This site pulls from
the OpenWeatherAPI and allows user to search and view forecasts in cities across the world. The site can display the wather for one day with attributes like temperature, feel, pressure and
humidity, while it can also give a 5-day forecast. My main take away from this repo was how many different options I am going to have in creating my weather app. The amount of data that could
be added goes way past what I anticipated before my research.


## Project Overview
My project will be a web application that will allow you to look up a city and state and it will return the weather for that day for that particular
city and state.

## Page Descriptions
My homepage or index page will be simple for now. Displaying a tool bar at the top with that name of the application a link back to the homepage, link to the
submittion page, and a link to the privacy page. The next page, the submition page. Will consist of that same tool bar at the top followed by headings
that prompt the user for city, state, and zip code.

## Future Enhancements
My first thought when beginning my application was how lame the homepage was. In the future I hope/plan to make the homepage more appealing
while maintaining that user friendly feel. Next, I will work on the lay out of the work out page to give it more of a spaced out and clean
feel. After completeing this, I will need to construct a page that will display the results after entering in the relevant information. After all
of that my main concern will be the layout and formatting of the whole application.
